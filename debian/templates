Template: canna/run_cannaserver
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should the Canna server run automatically?
 This package contains the Canna server and server-related
 utilities. If you are only interested in these utilities,
 you can disable the Canna server now.


Template: canna/run_with_inet
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Should the Canna server run in network mode?
 By default the Canna server will run without support for network
 connections, and will only accept connections on UNIX domain sockets,
 from clients running on the same host.

 If you choose this option, network support will be activated, and the
 Canna server will accept connections on TCP sockets from clients that
 may be on remote hosts. Some clients (such as egg and yc-el) require
 this mode even if they run on the local host.

Type: boolean
Default: true

Default: unix localhost
_Description: Hosts allowed to connect to this Canna server:
 Please enter the names of the hosts allowed to connect to this Canna server,
 separated by spaces.
