Template: canna/run_with_inet
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to connect to the Canna server from a remote host?
 The Canna server only allows connections via UNIX domain
 sockets when the `-inet' option is not specified.  This
 means that when the Canna server is started without the `-inet' option,
 only clients which run on the same host can connect to the server.
 Some clients such as, `egg' and `yc-el', do not support
 UNIX domain socket and require the `-inet' option, even if they run on
 the same host.
 .
 If you want to connect to this Canna server from remote hosts, or
 if you want to use INET-domain-only software, you should run
 the server with the `-inet' option.


Template: canna/manage_allow_hosts_with_debconf
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Manage /etc/hosts.canna with debconf ?

 .
 By default /etc/hosts.canna will be managed with debconf.
 Refuse here if you want to manage /etc/hosts.canna yourself.


Template: canna/allow_hosts
Type: string
Default: unix localhost
_Description: Please enter the name of each host allowed to connect to this server
 Please enter the names of the hosts allowed to connect to this Canna server,

 `unix'  is a special notation for allowing access
 via UNIX domain sockets.
