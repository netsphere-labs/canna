Template: canna/run_with_inet
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to connect to the Canna server from remote host?
 The Canna server only allows connections via UNIX domain
 sockets when `-inet' option is not specified.  It
 means that when Canna server is started without `-inet' option,
 only clients which run on the same host can connect to the server.
 Some clients such as `egg' and `yc-el' do not support 
 UNIX domain socket and  require `-inet' option even if they run on 
 the same host.
 .
 If you want to connect this Canna server from remote hosts or
 if you want to use INET-domain-only softwares, you should run
 the server with `-inet' option.


Template: canna/manage_allow_hosts_with_debconf
